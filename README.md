# Thesis Experimental Study Example

Unity based game used to perform an experimental study regarding my dissertation. The study was hosted on the Prolific website, so to start the game, you have to enter an initial 24-characters ID, which can be random. The example is being hosted in https://paulo-n-alexandre.github.io/pestcontrolstudy/econdition/ . At the end of the game, you will be redirected to a questionnaire, which is no longer available and can be ignored.
